if you want to restrict your application, only that user can make changes to his work that he have created like he create a book and now only he can modify it, then you need to follow these steps,

First we need to make an association because we will know which user make these changes setup for it..
 Set Up the Association in Models
You need to establish a relationship between the User model and the Book model.
You know about user if not than take it(Here user is used as a devise model you also can create other model to implement it)..
User Model (user.rb):put this line..
	  has_many :books, dependent: :destroy
	  
Book Model (book.rb) put this line..
	 belongs_to :user
	 
Create the Migration to Add user_id to Books
You need a migration to add a user_id column to the books table to store the association:
	rails generate migration AddUserIdToBooks user:references
	rails db:migrate

you encounterd any error than you will need to delete the posts or all data in of that model in which you are going to restrict users..

In that files path terminal..
rails console
Make an object of that table for example:
	Book.destroy_all

Checkout the schema of this application and take a look at migration
And now add this line to create action in associated model's controller
	@book = current_user.books.build(book_params)
	
And using can? condition restrict user..
 def update
    @book = Book.find(params[:id])
    if can?(:update, @book)
    if @book.update(book_params)
      redirect_to @book, notice: "Book was successfully updated."
    else
      render :edit
    end
    else
    redirect_to book_path, notice: "Access denied: You don't have permission to update this post."
    end
  end
  
Also make an destroy action using this ..

In Ability Class that is an CanCan class put this data to CanCan class

include CanCan::Ability

  def initialize(user)
    user ||= User.new  # Guest user

    if user.admin?
      can :manage, :all  # Admins can manage everything
    else
      can :read, Book  # All users can read all books
      can :create, Book  # All users can create books
      can [:update, :destroy], Book, user_id: user.id  # Only update or destroy books they created
    end
  end
