Generating a Model

We're going to see the same generator that we used before when creating the Article model. This time we'll create a Comment model to hold a reference to an article. Run this command in your terminal:

	bin/rails generate model Comment commenter:string body:text article:references

	bin/rails db:migrate

Put this line to that model's rb file in which the other tables's primary key lies as a foreign key.

	#class Comment < ApplicationRecord
	  belongs_to :article
	#end

Also write out these lines to the primary key model's rb file

	#class Article < ApplicationRecord
	  has_many :comments

	  validates :title, presence: true
	  validates :body, presence: true, length: { minimum: 10 }
	#end

And write the root path as like,the other model's resources must be nested in primary key model's resources..like this.
	
	#Rails.application.routes.draw do
	  root "articles#index"

	  resources :articles do
	    resources :comments
	 # end
	#end

And generate a controller of second model who control this model.
