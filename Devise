bundle add devise (in Gemfile, add 'gem "devise"' at the center of the file)
bundle install
rails generate devise:install

At this point, a number of instructions will appear in the console. Among these instructions, you'll need to set up the default URL options for the Devise mailer in each environment. Here is a possible configuration for config/environments/development.rb:

'config.action_mailer.default_url_options = { host: 'localhost', port: 3000 }'

rails generate devise MODEL_Name
rails db:migrate

Devise will create some helpers to use inside your controllers and views. To set up a controller with user authentication, just add this before_action (assuming your devise model is 'User'):

before_action :authenticate_user!, only: [:new, :create, :edit, :update, :destroy]

protect_from_forgery prepend: true
rails generate devise:views

If you have more than one Devise model in your application (such as User and Admin), you will notice that Devise uses the same views for all models. Fortunately, Devise offers an easy way to customize views. All you need to do is set config.scoped_views = true inside the config/initializers/devise.rb file.

After doing so, you will be able to have views based on the role like users/sessions/new and admins/sessions/new. If no view is found within the scope, Devise will use the default view at devise/sessions/new. You can also use the generator to generate scoped views:

rails generate devise:users views
make sure the routes.rb file ..

	Rails.application.routes.draw do
	  devise_for :users
	  
	  resources :books #associating controller name
	  
	  root to: "books#index" #associating controller action
	end

And also put these lines in custom controller, after the before action line..

	 def after_sign_in_path_for(resource)
	    books_path # Redirect to the dashboard after sign-in
	  end

	  def after_sign_out_path_for(resource_or_scope)
	    root_path # Redirect to the homepage after sign-out
	  end
	  
Define all the actions you want to restrict..
Run the server using rails s OR rails server
run on the browser's localhost/3000..

SECURITY
Basic Authentication

Put this line to appropriate controller' starting.. Here you can also update user restrictions and authentication measures..
	http_basic_authenticate_with name: "dhh", password: "secret", except: [:index, :show]
