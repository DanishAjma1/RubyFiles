1. Add pagy gem in gem file:

   gem "pagy"

2. Run bundle install in terminal. This will install pagy gem.

3. Create a file named "pagy.rb" in "initializers" folder located at "config/initializers"

4. Put the following code in pagy.rb:

   require "pagy/extras/bootstrap"
   Pagy::DEFAULT[:limit] = 5


5. Include Pagy::Backend in your ApplicationController located at "app/controllers/  
   application_controller.rb":
   
   class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
     include Pagy::Backend
   end
   
   
6. Include Pagy::Frontend in your ApplicationHelper located at "app/helpers/application_helper.rb"

   module ApplicationHelper
     include Pagy::Frontend
   end   

7. Include the following code in your controller for me it is posts_controller 


  def index
    if params[:query].present?
      @pagy, @posts = pagy(Post.search_posts(params[:query]))
    else
      @pagy, @posts = pagy(Post.all)
    end
  end

   
8. Display pagination in your views like in index.html.erb by writing the following code:

   <div>
      <%= pagy_nav(@pagy) %>
   </div>
   

9. Incase an html escaping error occurs while rendering the html that we added in views 
   previously then you can resolve this by adding .html_safe like this:
   
   
   <div>
      <%= pagy_nav(@pagy).html_safe %>
   </div>
