How to Set Up CanCanCan
Add the Gem: In your Gemfile, add CanCanCan:

gem 'cancancan', '~> 3.3'

bundle install

Generate the Ability Class: The Ability class is where you define all your permissions.
Generate the Ability class using:

	rails g cancan:ability
	
Define Abilities: In the ability.rb file, define the abilities for different user roles. For example:

class Ability
  include CanCan::Ability

  def initialize(user)
    # Define abilities for the passed in user here. For example:
    user ||= User.new # guest user (not logged in)

    if user.admin?
      can :manage, :all
    else
      can :read, :all
      can :create, Post
      can [:update, :destroy], Post, user_id: user.id
    end
  end
end

class PostsController < ApplicationController
  load_and_authorize_resource
end

You can handle this in your ApplicationController:

class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  rescue_from CanCan::AccessDenied do |exception|
    redirect_to root_url, alert: exception.message
  end
end
